# ASTRA — Unified Research Lab + MCP Server

**Agent-orchestrated Simulation Testbed for Research on Awareness**

> **Data provenance.** All biological and physiological data produced by this server
> are **simulated**. No living tissue, organoid, human subject or Koniku hardware is
> connected: the NeuroPlatform bridge is instantiated in simulate mode, the OVOMIND live
> adapter is an unimplemented stub, and the sensory encoders are untrained
> re-implementations inspired by V-JEPA 2 / A-JEPA. The consciousness-related indices
> are **computed proxies, not measurements**, and ASTRA makes **no claim of sentience**
> (the acronym's former expansion, *Autonomous Sentient Thoughtful Reasoning Agent*, is
> withdrawn — see `src/engine/tcai/phenomenal-guard.ts`).

> **First empirical test (E1).** The organoid surrogate's spontaneous activity was
> confronted with three real human brain organoids (DANDI 001603) under a preregistration
> made public *before* the data were received. Verdict: **INADEQUATE** — the real
> organoids burst and synchronise, the surrogate emits independent Poisson trains; the
> failure is structural, not parametric. Protocol, results and replay:
> [`empirical/`](empirical/RESULTS-E1.md).
>
> **Second test (E2, preregistered).** A candidate revision
> (`spontaneousModel: 'network-burst'`: shared network bursts + locally clustered
> background, 9 parameters calibrated on the three E1 organoids only) was frozen, made
> public, then confronted with five **unseen** organoids (sub-HO1…HO5), with the E1 model
> as negative control. Verdict: **PARTIALLY ADEQUATE** (0 incompatible, 2 compatible,
> 3 marginal; the a-priori prediction "adequate" is refuted; the control stays
> INADEQUATE). The structural E1 failure is fixed, but the calibration does not transfer
> across organoids, notably to older (7-month) ones. The default model stays `'poisson'`.

Production-grade [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server exposing the ASTRA bio-hybrid neuromorphic simulation pipeline to AI assistants. Built with the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, it integrates a layered SNN LIF+STDP engine, consciousness proxy assessment, bio-computing platform telemetry, and an IRB ethics monitor — all queryable as MCP tools, resources, and prompts from **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, **VS Code**, and any MCP-compatible client.

## 🆕 v3.1.0 — FCS layer: substrate-constrained functionalism

Implements the values of the FCS series (documents I v1.5, II v1.4, IV v1.2,
synthesis S-1.5) inside ASTRA as `fcs_*` tools — **not** as a scoring module.

- **The stratification is computed, never hard-coded.** The seventeen
  species–function pairs are ordered by **Pareto dominance** over three ordinal
  sub-criteria (causal distance to the carrier, time constant, ablation effect),
  peeled into a partial order. `tests/fcs.test.ts` asserts that the result
  reproduces the **eight strata published in document IV §3** exactly — the only
  way to know the transcription is right.
- **No aggregate score exists, anywhere in the layer.** The series' negative
  heuristic forbids aggregating ordinal criteria lacking a common scale
  (prohibition 4, after Okasha 2011). `mayAggregate()` refuses such a
  combination at runtime; `refuseAggregate()` returns a withheld scalar carrying
  its reason instead of a number.
- **The IRB welfare biomarkers are bound to the taxonomy.** Extracellular Ca²⁺
  is class 1 as mobile charge, ATP/ADP is class 7, firing rate is the class-3
  generator signature, viability stands proxy for class 2b. A drifting biomarker
  becomes a statement about which pair has left its operating range. A silent
  channel yields `withheld()`, never zero.
- **The silicon SNN realises no constitutive pair**, and the audit says so:
  under the substrate constraint the level-I carrier is absent there, whatever
  the level-III/IV profile shows.
- **Two linters gate every payload** — `lintClaim` (Block's access/phenomenal
  distinction) and `lintFcs` (the five prohibitions), the latter distinguishing
  use from mention so that stating a prohibition or citing a title does not fire it.
- MCP surface: 62 → **70 tools** (`fcs_*` ×8); resources 11 → 15, prompts 8 → 10.
  Test suite 241 → **317 tests** (69 in `tests/fcs.test.ts`, 7 in `tests/annotations.test.ts`).
- **MCP tool annotations** on all 70 tools (title + read-only / destructive / idempotent /
  open-world hints), classified from each handler's code — see [MCP Tools](#mcp-tools-70).
- **Corrections before dissemination.** Acronym re-expanded without "Sentient"; data
  provenance stated up front; encoder labels now read "…-inspired (untrained)";
  `get_acm_score` retitled as a composite proxy; every stochastic component draws from one
  **seeded** generator (`ASTRA_SEED`, reported by `get_system_status`, `export_snapshot`
  and `/health`); third-party article copies replaced by a DOI bibliography;
  [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff),
  [`PREREGISTRATION.md`](PREREGISTRATION.md) and [`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md) added.
  Test suite **323 tests** (6 in `tests/reproducibility.test.ts`).
- **Dependencies hardened.** `express` 4 → 5 (the MCP SDK already ran on Express 5; the
  project's `@types/express` were already v5) and `tsx` → 4.23 (bundles a patched
  `esbuild`): `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities** (previously 11, of which 7 in
  runtime dependencies). No code change was needed; the 12 transport tests pass unchanged.
- **New console:** `dashboard/ASTRA-FCS-Dashboard.html` — self-contained,
  bilingual FR/EN, recomputing the partial order in the browser and reporting
  whether it reproduces the published strata.

## 🆕 v3.0.1 — Transport-layer audit: blocking fix + integration suite

A code audit of the v3.0 tree found that **both HTTP transports were inoperative at
runtime** despite a fully green test suite. `express.json()` consumes the request
stream, and the MCP SDK requires the already-parsed body to be handed back
(`handleRequest(req, res, req.body)` / `handlePostMessage(req, res, req.body)`);
without it the SDK re-read an empty stream and every client→server POST hung until
timeout. The 229 tests never exercised the transports, so the defect survived them.

- **Fix**: parsed body forwarded at all four call sites (`http-server.ts` ×3,
  `sse-server.ts` ×1). Verified end-to-end: `initialize` → `tools/list` (62) → `DELETE`.
- **Session-leak guard**: a POST without a session that is not a valid `initialize`
  now returns a JSON-RPC `-32000` (HTTP 400) instead of silently constructing an
  orphaned server instance.
- **Version unified**: `src/version.ts` is the single source of truth. The MCP server
  previously announced `2.2.0` to clients, while `/health` reported `2.0.0` (SSE) and
  `2.9.0` (HTTP).
- **Bind address**: both transports default to `127.0.0.1`; containers set `0.0.0.0`
  explicitly. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).
- **Lint restored**: ESLint ≥ 9 requires a flat config, which the repo lacked — `npm run
  lint` failed outright and CI tolerated it via `continue-on-error`. `eslint.config.js`
  is now wired and lint is a **blocking** CI gate.
- **New suite**: `tests/transports.test.ts` — 12 integration tests over both HTTP
  transports (session lifecycle, tool-count contract, CORS preflight, guards, and
  named regression tests under a hard timeout so a re-introduced hang fails loudly
  rather than freezing the run). Total: **241 tests**.

Testability required a small refactor: `createHttpApp()` and `createSseApp()` are now
exported factories bound to ephemeral ports by the tests, while an `import.meta.url`
entry-point guard preserves direct `node dist/*-server.js` execution.

## 🆕 v3.0 — Unified release: OVOMIND bridge + Orch OR criterion layer + CI fix

v3.0 = the full v2.9 core (unchanged) **plus** the affective exteroception
bridge and the Orch OR substrate-criterion layer, wired and passing:

- `src/engine/ovomind.ts` — OVOMIND adapter (sim by default; the live adapter is
  a deliberate stub pending a vendor API contract), Russell→PAD lift (dominance
  is never estimated from peripheral physiology), gated closed-loop controller
  (ships disarmed; refuses to arm without a protocol reference).
- `src/engine/tcai/phenomenal-guard.ts` — epistemic tiers (`access`/`functional`
  only — no constructor for a phenomenal claim), Argonov ledger, Metzinger gate,
  claim linter. All 12 new tools route their output through it.
- `src/engine/tcai/orch-or.ts` — Penrose criterion τ=ℏ/E_G with the displacement
  scale exposed as the free parameter it is, decoherence budget (verdict:
  UNRESOLVED), per-substrate verdicts, and a classical surrogate gate (temporal
  signature only — explicitly NOT an implementation of Orch OR).
- MCP surface: 50 → **62 tools** (`ovo_*` ×6, `orch_*` ×6); resources and
  prompts unchanged (11 · 8). The stdio smoke test asserts the new count.

Docs: `OVOMIND-INTEGRATION.md` (FR) · `ORCH-OR-INTEGRATION.fr.md` / `.en.md`.

**CI fix shipped in this release.** The previous lockfile pinned
`safe-stable-stringify@2.9.0` — a version that does not exist on the npm
registry (both matrix jobs failed at `npm ci` with E404 in ~17 s). The lockfile
now pins 2.5.0, which satisfies pino's `^2.3.1`. `ci.yml` also gains the
Python + numpy setup that `golden:check` silently required, bumps actions to
v5 (ends the Node 20 deprecation warnings), and updates the tool-count
assertion to 62.

Note: the separate `ASTRA-3.0-` repository (CL1 ↔ Unreal Engine UDP bridge,
Python) is a **companion system**, not a version of this MCP server, and is
not merged here.

## 🆕 v2.9 — Setpoint regulation + real production loop

ASTRA v2.9 makes the continuous controller **non-degenerate**: instead of ramping the substrate to maximum, it **regulates toward a configurable setpoint** (homeostatic drive cost ⇒ interior optimum; the realised feature tracks the setpoint). The closed loop can now run **through the shared production SNN** (read + write) via `setProductionLoop`, genuinely closing on the deployed network — off by default to avoid contention with `snn_step`. The two active-inference roles are made explicit (discrete core = perception/F; continuous controller = control), with `controllerSetpoint`/`controllerModelError` surfaced in telemetry and `setpoint`/`productionLoop` exposed on `tcai_cycle`. *Still a linear forward model over a synthetic SNN-firing proxy.* See **[SECOND-ORDER-LOOP-INTEGRATION.md](SECOND-ORDER-LOOP-INTEGRATION.md)**.

## 🆕 v2.2 — `the_consciousness_ai` (ACM) Integration

ASTRA v2.2 integrates **[tlcdv/the_consciousness_ai](https://github.com/tlcdv/the_consciousness_ai)** — the Artificial Consciousness Module research codebase — at two levels:

- **Native TypeScript port** (`src/engine/tcai/`): Global Neuronal Workspace with sigmoid ignition & reverberation, Kuramoto/AKOrN oscillatory binding, PAD emotional processing & reward shaping, attention-gated emotional memory, self-representation core + attention schema, and a metrics suite (GNW · Effective Information · Φ̃-RIIU) — all fed live from the SNN/world-model state and exposed as **8 new MCP tools** (`tcai_cycle`, `tcai_workspace_state`, `tcai_emotion_appraise`, `tcai_memory_store`, `tcai_memory_retrieve`, `tcai_self_model`, `tcai_metrics`, `tcai_reset`).
- **Full vendored Python codebase** (`python/the_consciousness_ai/`, 291 files — distributed under its own **non-commercial** licence, see [License](#license) and [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)): the complete upstream ACM project for reference and PyTorch-based reproduction.

See **[TCAI-INTEGRATION.md](TCAI-INTEGRATION.md)** for the complete Python → TypeScript mapping and architecture coupling. All consciousness-related metrics remain **computational proxies**, not measurements.

## 🆕 v2.2 — FinalSpark NeuroPlatform v2 Integration

ASTRA v2.2 also integrates the **[FinalSpark NeuroPlatform v2](https://finalspark-np.github.io/np-docs/np_core/doc_v2.html)** wetware control API — the closed-loop interface to living neural organoids on a 128-electrode MEA — at two levels:

- **Native TypeScript port + integration-test surrogate** (`src/engine/neuroplatform.ts`): faithful port of the NeuroPlatform controller surface (`StimParam` with charge-balance checking, `IntanController`, `TriggerController`, `DatabaseController`, `CameraController`) backed by a seeded `OrganoidMEA` model — exposed as **9 new MCP tools** (`np_status`, `np_configure_stim`, `np_send_trigger`, `np_count_spikes`, `np_query_spike_count`, `np_query_spike_events`, `np_query_triggers`, `np_camera_capture`, `np_closed_loop`). The MEA's 128 electrodes couple one-to-one with the ASTRA SNN's 128 neurons.
- **Live Python bridge** (`python/neuroplatform/astra_np_bridge.py`): runs a homeostatic closed loop against the physical platform via the genuine `neuroplatformv2` SDK, streaming couplings to ASTRA over JSON-RPC.
- **Standalone dashboard** (`dashboard/ASTRA-NeuroPlatform-Dashboard.html`): live MEA raster, spike scope, `StimParam` editor with charge-balance readout, trigger generator and closed-loop telemetry.

See **[NEUROPLATFORM-INTEGRATION.md](NEUROPLATFORM-INTEGRATION.md)** for the complete API → TypeScript mapping. With no hardware attached the server runs in **simulate mode** (deterministic Poisson surrogate), **not** living-tissue measurements. The surrogate's spontaneous activity was confronted with real human brain organoids (DANDI 001603) under a public preregistration and found **inadequate** (no network bursts, no synchrony) — see [`empirical/RESULTS-E1.md`](empirical/RESULTS-E1.md).

> **Note on data mode:** In the default `sim` mode, all bio-platform data is synthetically generated. The server is designed to connect to live platforms in `live` mode, but this requires hardware access and appropriate IRB approval.

## What's New in v2

- **Layered SNN architecture:** Configurable feed-forward + recurrent topology (default: 32→64→16→16 = 128 neurons) replacing the flat random network
- **Event-driven STDP:** O(spikes × fan-out) instead of O(N²) per timestep
- **Ring buffer:** O(1) spike history eviction replacing O(n) `Array.shift()`
- **Sparse weight storage:** Adjacency lists instead of dense N×N matrix
- **Honest ACM naming:** Proxies clearly labelled as `integrationProxy`, `broadcastProxy`, `arousalProxy` with methodological basis strings — no false IIT/GWT/PAD claims
- **Bounds-checked parameters:** `set_parameter` rejects implausible values (NaN, Infinity, out-of-range)
- **Mode-aware ethics:** Reports distinguish simulated vs live data with explicit disclaimers
- **CI pipeline:** GitHub Actions for build, test, and Docker smoke-test
- **Repo hygiene:** `dist/` excluded from VCS, `.gitignore` added, deployment script removed

## MCP Tools (70)

Counts below are asserted by the CI stdio smoke test, not maintained by hand.
Every tool declares a title and the four MCP
[tool annotations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/server/tools)
(`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`), from a single table:
[`src/tool-annotations.ts`](src/tool-annotations.ts). The classification follows each
handler's code, not its name — e.g. `wm_encode` is **not** read-only (it feeds the history
`wm_surprise` reads), `tcai_curiosity` trains its predictor, `np_count_spikes` advances the
simulated MEA clock. Only `ovo_read`, `ovo_cycle` and `orch_cycle` are open-world (OVOMIND
live API when configured). `tests/annotations.test.ts` asserts that the table and
`tools/list` match exactly. Hints are advisory, not a security boundary.

> **Extracted to separate repositories:** The v1 HTML dashboard (4 669 lines) and the legacy Node.js bridge config have been removed from this repo to keep it focused on the MCP server. See [ASTRA-Unified-ResearchLab-MCP-](https://github.com/christophejlegros-lgtm/ASTRA-Unified-ResearchLab-MCP-) for the original dashboard.

### SNN Engine

**Layered LIF+STDP** — Configurable layered architecture. Default: 32 (input) → 64 (hidden_1) → 16 (hidden_2) → 16 (output) = **128 neurons**.

Connectivity: feed-forward between adjacent layers (30%) + sparse recurrent within layers (10%). Weights stored as sparse adjacency lists, not dense matrices.

Biophysical parameters: τ_m = 20ms, V_th = −50mV, V_reset = −70mV, refractory = 2ms. Background noise range [10, 22] mV produces ~2 spikes/step at steady state with all neurons active. STDP: A+ = 0.01, A− = 0.012, τ± = 20ms, event-driven (processes only spiking neurons per timestep).

The SNN topology resource (`astra://snn/topology`) dynamically reports the **actual** engine configuration, including layer sizes, synapse count, connectivity parameters, and weight storage type (Map-indexed sparse adjacency lists).

### ACM — Consciousness Proxy Module

> ⚠ **Methodological disclaimer:** The metrics below are **computational proxies** inspired by the referenced theories. They are **not** faithful implementations. See source code comments for full details.

Composite score: `ACM = α·Φ̃ + β·GW̃ + γ·PAD̃` (default: α=0.40, β=0.35, γ=0.25)

| Component | Basis | Inspired by | What it actually measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| `integrationProxy` (Φ̃) | Active fraction + mean firing rate + synaptic heterogeneity | IIT (Tononi) | Network participation and complexity proxy. True Φ is NP-hard to compute. |
| `broadcastProxy` (GW̃) | Cross-layer firing rate synchrony (CV-based) | GWT (Baars) | Uniform activation across layers. Does not model competitive coalitions or ignition. |
| `arousalProxy` (PAD̃) | Spike rate + bio coupling + energy | PAD (Mehrabian) | Arousal dimension only. Pleasure and Dominance are not computed. |

### Ethics IRB Monitor

IRB compliance level **N3** (100K–1M neurons). Four biomarkers with three-state classification.

**Mode-aware:** In `sim` mode, reports include explicit disclaimers that data is synthetic and `irbRequired` is `false`. In `live` mode, DISTRESS triggers mandatory IRB notification.

| Biomarker | Normal | Stress | Critical |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cell viability | ≥ 90% | 80–90% | < 80% |
| Firing rate | 15–45 Hz | outside range | ≤ 5 or ≥ 60 Hz |
| ATP/ADP | ≥ 3.0 | 2.0–3.0 | < 2.0 |
| Calcium | < 100 nM | 100–200 nM | ≥ 200 nM |

### Parameter Bounds

The `set_parameter` tool validates all numeric inputs against a bounds registry to prevent injection of absurd values (negative percentages, Infinity, NaN). Bounds are defined per parameter path — see `src/engine/state.ts` for the complete registry.

## Testing

```bash
# Full suite
npm test

# Unit tests only
node --import tsx --test tests/astra.test.ts

# Integration tests only (Client SDK)
node --import tsx --test tests/integration.test.ts

# Targeted suites
npm run test:tcai          # TCAI/ACM
npm run test:np            # NeuroPlatform v2
npm run test:so            # second-order loop
npm run test:wm            # World Model
npm run test:sensors       # multimodal sensors
npm run test:transports    # HTTP + SSE transport layer
npm run test:fcs           # FCS layer
npm run test:annotations   # MCP tool annotations
npm run test:repro         # seeded reproducibility

# Static gates
npm run build              # tsc strict (Node16 ESM)
npm run lint               # ESLint 9 flat config
npm run golden:check       # TS↔NumPy active-inference golden (requires python3 + numpy)

# MCP Inspector
npm run inspect
```

> **Full suite: 323/323 passing** (229 engine/integration + 12 transport-layer + 69 FCS + 7 annotations + 6 reproducibility), 0 TypeScript errors
> (strict, Node16 ESM), 0 ESLint errors. Verified on Node 20 and Node 22 in CI.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev        # stdio (no build)
npm run dev:sse    # SSE on :9002
npm run dev:http   # HTTP on :9003
npm run watch      # TypeScript watch mode
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ASTRA_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `silent` |
| `ASTRA_SSE_PORT` | `9002` | SSE transport port |
| `ASTRA_SSE_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | SSE bind address |
| `ASTRA_HTTP_PORT` | `9003` | Streamable HTTP port |
| `ASTRA_HTTP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Streamable HTTP bind address |
| `ASTRA_CORS_ORIGIN` | `*` | CORS allowed origin |
| `ASTRA_SEED` | `20260923` | Seed of the global PRNG (unsigned 32-bit). Same seed ⇒ same random streams; wall-clock-driven ticks still interleave differently — for bit-level replay keep the simulation loop stopped and drive it with `snn_step`. |

> **Bind address defaults to loopback.** Both HTTP transports bind `127.0.0.1` so a
> local server is not exposed to the network by default (the permissive CORS default
> would otherwise widen the attack surface). The Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml`
> set `ASTRA_*_HOST=0.0.0.0` explicitly, since a container must accept traffic from
> outside its own namespace. Set it yourself for any non-container remote deployment —
> and set `ASTRA_CORS_ORIGIN` to a concrete origin when you do.

## Scaling Notes

The default 128-neuron configuration is designed for interactive demonstration. To scale toward the aspirational 256→512→256→128 (1 152 neurons) architecture:

1. Pass custom layers to `SNNEngine`: `new SNNEngine({ layers: [{ name: 'input', size: 256 }, ...] })`
2. Event-driven STDP scales as O(spikes × average fan-out), not O(N²)
3. Map-indexed adjacency lists provide O(1) weight lookup per synapse
4. Sparse storage keeps memory proportional to actual synapses (~18 KB at 128 neurons vs 64 KB dense)
5. Consider increasing `intervalMs` in the simulation loop for larger networks
6. For >10K neurons, a Rust/WASM or Lava SDK backend is recommended
